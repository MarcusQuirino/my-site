      Hi, My name is Marcus :3

    <article class='space-y-4 font-light text-justify leading-relaxed'>
      <p class=''>
        I'm a software engineer born in a city with the silly name of Porto
        Alegre in the south region of Brazil. I have {age} years and I'm currently
        working at <Link href={currentJob.link}>
          {currentJob.job}
        </Link>. I'm a self-taught full-stack web developer and my
        specialization lies in everything javascript-related from Node rest APIs
        to React apps.
      </p>
      <p class=''>
        I like TTRPG, working out, and crafting software that makes people's
        lives better. I love building projects and have a particular interest in
        system architecture and performance. Currently really enjoying building
        stuff with <Link href='https://www.typescriptlang.org/'>
          Typescript
        </Link>, <Link href='https://create.t3.gg/'>T3 stack</Link>, and <Link
          href='https://aws.amazon.com/pt/'
        >
          AWS
        </Link>.
      </p>
      <p class=''>
        I love to talk about myself and the things I like so if you are
        interested professionally with me, you can check my <Link href='/cv'>
