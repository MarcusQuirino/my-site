I had to search this stand in the internet because I never gave two thoughts
about it. It's a 15,6" NBC-50BK C3Tech notebook stand.

I't came with my wellcome kit when I started working at my current job.

I use it everyday at work, and I could try to find things to talk about but is a
ok stand.

The stand don't make my notebook a lot higher, wich is anoying, and is very
bulky, but it comes in handy in the rare ocasions my macbook gets hot. I used to
play Better Minecraft wich is a fairly big and demanding modpack while I host a
server, and the stand helped with a surprisingly quiet RGB (with just the B)
fan.

it's not sexy, I would not recomended if you want something fancy and I would
probably buy a new one if I was not such a cheapskate.
