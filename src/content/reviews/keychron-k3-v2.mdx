when I bougth this keyboard I was looking for a machanical, wireless but that I
could put a cable if I needed, compact keyboard.

I got all of that with this keyboard, But am I happy with it?

I'm not sure.

would I recomended it?

Absolutely. But I would probably ask a quesions first:

_*Do you want a secundary keyboard?*_

with secundary I mean a keyboard that you can carry around with you to replace
the stock keyboard of a laptop. If you do, this is a great option, it's small,
portable, and you can by a really cute case for it.

But if you are looking for a keyboard to use as your main keyboard, I would
still recomend it, but I would tell you to look for more options just to be sure
that is what you want. If you realy like the small form factor, and slick
desing, go for it.

Don't get me wrong, I like this keyboard , but as a main keyboard, I should
probably go with a bigger one.

### swithes

I got the brown swithes, and I like them, they are not too loud.

if you are thinking of getting red swithes, plese don't bring then to the office
of public quiet spaces and for the love of god, don't get the blue ones.
