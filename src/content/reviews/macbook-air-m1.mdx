I simply love this machine.

Even though I have a maxed out <Link href="/setup/macbook-pro-m1/">16" M1
Macbook Pro</Link>, I still prefer to use this one for most of my work.

It's light, it's fast, got a great battery life, and for web development, it's
more than enough even if is the baseline model.

I love that I can just put in on my lap and work almost optimally since the
keyboard is so good and it does not get hot.

The sound is also surprisingly good for such a small machine and I can use to
listen to some music with someone else if I don't have a speaker around.

You can even do some ligth gaming on it, I've been playing some minecraft with a
dozens or so mods and it runs great.

The screen is fine, it's sharp and the colors are good, but I'm a sucker for
AMOLED and higher refresh rates. Also the size is ok if it's on my lap but seems
kinda smol when I'm using it on a desk. I say that I wouldn't change this
machine for any other, but things can change with this new 15" macbook air M2
ðŸ‘€.

The only downside that since that this was my first apple product, it was my
gateway drug for the ecosystem and now I have an
<Link href="/setup/iphone-13/">iPhone</Link> and the noise canceling the airpods
pro 2 seems so good...
