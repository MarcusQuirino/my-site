They are the best earbuds I've ever owned. They are comfortable, have a great
sound quality and the noise cancellation is good. I use them as my daily driver
every day for almost everything.

I need good noise cancellation almost as much as I need good sound quality. I
don't consider myself an audiophile, but I do enjoy good sound quality and this
pass my test. But the noise cancelling could be better.

don't get me wrong, they are very good for a wireless earbud but I could use
some of that real time sound processing that the airpods pro 2 have or some of
the isolation of a good headphone.

I have a problem with noises and I can't walk a buzy street or a crowded space
without feeling overwhelmed and a bit strsseed. I need to be able to isolate and
they do a good enough job.

Lots of accidental touches When you are trying to adjust the earbud in your ear.

besides that, they are great. The battery life is super good, the case is
relativelly small and they are surprisingly sturdy. I've dropped them a few (a
lot) of times and they are still working perfectly with minimal scratches.
