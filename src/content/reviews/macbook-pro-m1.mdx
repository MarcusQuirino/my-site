Ok, it's not realy _mine_, but I'm using it as my main machine at work and I
think we just have this on my company because they have too much money.

it's a absolute _beast_.

Since it's my work machine I don't have much liberty to test what a _maxed out_
machine with the price tag of car on my country can do, but I'm sure it's a lot.

I think it's the everything a work machine should be.

everything is _blanzingly fast_, the screen is big and beautiful, the keyboard
is great and the sound is surreal.

But still prefer my <Link href="/setup/macbook-air-m1/">macbook air M1</Link>.

it's just so much ligther and more portable and the fact that I can work
confortably wherever I want is just priceless. (figuratively, it's actually very
pricey)
