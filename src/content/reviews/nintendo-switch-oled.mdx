I mean

it's not a thing that is critical to my setup, but it's always on my desk
waiting for me to play and relax a bit.

My first (and only) console was a Nintendo Wii (wich is a good indicator of my
age) and maybe because of nostalgia but I kinda Nintendo fanboy.

I've always liked the way they make consoles and games, my favorite franchises
were always from Nintendo and the fact that the wii was my only console for a
long time made me replay the same games over and over again. But I never got
bored.

But I think the main reason I like got a switch is because I have always wanted
a portable console. My frieds had PSPs, DSs an stuff like that and I dreamed
with the possibility of playing games on the go. (and on the bed without my
parents knowing)

When I was planing to buy a portable console I was thinking about getting a
steam deck, but was not easy do get on Brazil at the time and I was not sure
about importing it. So I decided to get a switch. (specifically the OLED model
Splatton 3 edition (I heve never played splatton, but I liked the design))

And I'm glad I did.

I love the switch, is the greatest console ever made by far.
