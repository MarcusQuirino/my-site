I think is the quintessential _productivity_ mouse that every tech person have.

You probably already saw a review of it so I won't go into details. It's the
mouse of choice of <Link href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A18BST27Wpw&t=359s'>MKBHD</Link> and
everything you already heard about it is true.

It's a great mouse, with a great battery life, and a great scroll wheel, and oh
boy, the scroll wheel is fun. I think the best part of this mouse is that the
magnetic scroll wheel doubles as a fidget spinner (remember those?) and my ADHD
brain loves it. it's a great way to keep my hands busy while I'm thinking and
scrolling tousand lines CSVs. (don't want to talk about that)

the customization is great, and you can do more than you think with the logitech
software.

unfortunately, I'm work towards a fully keyboard workflow, so I don't use it as
much as I used to.

Since we are in this topic, why you don't check my review of the my keyboard the <Link href='/setup/keychron-k3-v2/'>Keychron K3 v2</Link>?
