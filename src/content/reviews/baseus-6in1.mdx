been a mac user implies been a dongle user. There is no scape

I haven't give to much thought on what usb hub I should buy and this one was a
recommendation from a friend of mine and I'm pretty happy with it.

this is the 6 in that have 3 usb ports, ethernet, hdmi, and 1 usb c port for
charging and stuff.

I mean, it's a dongle, it's not that exciting, but I thought that I would feel
more the lack of ports, but realisticaly I don't use that many the ports since
everything I use is wireless now.

I recommend this one because it's cheap and it works, if you are need more ports
you can get the 8 in 1 version.

but that it's it, it's a dongle. yay!
