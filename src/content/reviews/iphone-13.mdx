I was always a Android guy, but since I bought
the<Link href="/setup/macbook-air-m1/">M1 macbook air</Link> and realy liked
it, I decided to give the Iphone a try and for anyone's surprise I obviously
liked.

everything is so smooth and the camera is amazing 90% of the time, the screen is
very good, (even though the fact that it's not AMOLED and don't have more than
60hz is rediculous for a phone at this price) the battery is good enough but
have really good fast charging so I don't really care about it.

But for me the best part is the integration with the macbook, using the phone as
a webcam or microphone, airdrop, and shared apps like notes, reminders (I can't
function anymore without this), and the fact that I can copy something on the
mac and paste on the phone and vice versa is like black magic for me till this
day.

With all that said, I think that my main takeaway from my first Iphone is that
is a very boring phone. I mean, it's a very good phone, but it's just it, at
leat the base model. dosn't have that classic Android feature that can be gimmic
but adds to the charm of the phone. No 300hz screen, 100x zoom, 15 cameras or a
3 day battery life. It's just a very good all around phone.

I came from a world where Moto Z 2 play exixts, this is to this day my favorite
phone ever, full of gimmics, and the sole reason I can't look at a screen that
is not AMOLED. (this in 2017 when AMOLED was not something you take for granted)

In the end, I think that I will keep using Iphones for a while, I kinda locked
me in the ecosystem with the macbook, and its not something I'm too mad about
it. I will probably continuing buying Iphones as long as I keep using macbooks and
someday I will probably get a Android phone again, just to see what I missed.
